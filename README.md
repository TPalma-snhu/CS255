# CS255 Final Project - DriverPass System

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

### This project involved designing a system for a client named DriverPass, which aimed to fill a gap in the market for individuals preparing to take their driver's license exams. The client wanted a system that would allow users to schedule driving lessons, receive feedback from instructors, get updates from the DMV, and allow users to make payments. Additionally, the system needed to be cross-platform compatible, as well as provide around the clock IT help for users. The overall goal was to create a comprehensive platform that enhances users' chances of success in their driving exams by providing structured and accessible driving instruction through courses and instructor feedback.

## What did you do particularly well?

### Personally, I feel as though I did a good job of extracting requirements from the interview with DriverPass. Separating them into both functional and nonfunctional requirements, I was able to describe a thorough and clear system which will check all of the boxes for the client, DriverPass. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

### The diagrams that I created detailed all of the processes for the DriverPass system almost fully. This is the area where I would go back and use more of the UML keys and tools to describe the system more in detail to ensure the development goes as smoothly as possible. 

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

### User needs were taken into account when thinking of security, as wel las UI/UX. A product will not be successful if it is not usable for user which is why it is so critical to develop an intuitive system which requires a low technological bar for entry. 

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

### My approach to designing software has evolved into more upfront planning and designing before beginning the actual coding process. After taking this course, I now know how to extrapolate requirements for the product to then add to the design. Leveraging the tools I learned in this course, such as, class diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams, my planning process will be taken to the next level helping me greatly in the development process.
